First one is controllers/tokens.js:

This code block defines a SessionsController object with a Create method that handles user authentication. The SessionsController object is exported as a module so it can be used by other parts of the application.

The code starts by requiring two modules, User and TokenGenerator. The User module is used to find a user with a given email, and the TokenGenerator module is used to generate a JSON Web Token.

The Create method on the SessionsController object is a middleware function that handles user authentication. It first gets the email and password from the request body. It then uses the User model to find a user with the given email. If the user isn't found, it returns a 401 unauthorized error. If the password doesn't match, it returns a 401 unauthorized error. Otherwise, it generates a JSON Web Token using the TokenGenerator model and the user's id, and returns it with a 201 status code.

Second one is models/token_generator.js: 

This code block defines a TokenGenerator class with a static method called "jsonwebtoken" that generates a JSON Web Token using the user_id passed as an argument and the JWT sign method from the jsonwebtoken module.

The TokenGenerator class exports a single method, which is used by the SessionsController module to generate a JSON Web Token for authenticated users.

The code block starts by requiring the jsonwebtoken module, which is used to generate the JSON Web Token. It then gets the JWT secret from the environment variables.

The jsonwebtoken method of the TokenGenerator class takes a user_id as an argument, generates a new JSON Web Token using the JWT sign method, and returns the token. The token contains the user_id, the current time as a "iat" (issued at) claim, and an expiration time set to 10 minutes from the current time.

Finally, the TokenGenerator class is exported as a module so it can be used by other parts of the application.

---

Next one is routes/tokens.js: 

This code block defines a router for the TokensController module. The router is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to user authentication and JSON Web Tokens.

The code starts by requiring the express module and creating a new router using the express.Router method. The router is then exported as a module so it can be used by other parts of the application.

The TokensController module is imported using the require method, and its Create method is mapped to a POST route on the router. This means that when an HTTP POST request is made to the "/tokens" endpoint, the TokensController's Create method will be called to handle the request.

The TokensController's Create method is responsible for user authentication and generating a JSON Web Token. The router simply provides a way for the method to be called when an HTTP request is received on the "/tokens" endpoint.

---

Next one is spec/controllers/tokens.spec.js:

This code block contains a test suite for the TokensController module. The suite tests the behavior of the "/tokens" endpoint, which is responsible for handling user authentication and returning a JSON Web Token.

The code starts by importing the necessary dependencies, including the app module (which is responsible for creating the Express app), the supertest module (which is used for HTTP testing), and the mongodb_helper module (which sets up a test database for the tests to use).

The describe function is used to group related test cases. In this case, all of the tests are related to the "/tokens" endpoint.

The beforeAll function is used to create a new user before running the tests. The user is created using the User model and saved to the test database. This ensures that the tests have a valid user to authenticate.

The afterAll function is used to delete all users from the test database after the tests have run. This ensures that the test database is cleaned up after the tests are finished.

Two test cases are defined using the test function. The first test case tests that a valid request returns a new JSON Web Token. It sends a POST request to the "/tokens" endpoint with valid user credentials and tests that the response status is 201 (Created) and that a token is returned with a "OK" message.

The second test case tests that an invalid request does not return a JSON Web Token. It sends a POST request to the "/tokens" endpoint with invalid user credentials and tests that the response status is 401 (Unauthorized) and that no token is returned with an "auth error" message.

---

Last one is spec/models/token_generator.spec.js:

This code block contains a test suite for the TokenGenerator module. The suite tests the behavior of the jsonwebtoken function, which is responsible for generating a JSON Web Token.

The code starts by importing the necessary dependencies, including the TokenGenerator module and the jsonwebtoken module.

The describe function is used to group related test cases. In this case, all of the tests are related to the TokenGenerator module.

The describe function is also used to group tests related to the jsonwebtoken function. The test function is used to define a single test case.

The test case tests that the jsonwebtoken function returns a valid token containing a user_id that is valid for 10 minutes. It sets the user_id to 1 for the test, generates a token using the jsonwebtoken function, and decodes the token payload using the JWT decode function.

The test case then checks that the decoded payload contains the expected user_id and that the token is valid for 10 minutes (600 seconds).

Overall, this test suite ensures that the jsonwebtoken function of the TokenGenerator module generates a valid JSON Web Token with the expected payload.


------------ SUMMARY ---------------


The purpose of this code is to handle user authentication and generate JSON Web Tokens for authenticated users. The application consists of several files that work together to achieve this goal:

controllers/tokens.js: This file defines the SessionsController object with a Create method that handles user authentication. It uses the User model to find a user with the given email and password, and if authentication is successful, it generates a JSON Web Token using the TokenGenerator model.

models/token_generator.js: This file defines the TokenGenerator class with a jsonwebtoken method that generates a JSON Web Token using the jsonwebtoken module. The class exports a single method that is used by the SessionsController module to generate a JSON Web Token for authenticated users.

routes/tokens.js: This file defines a router for the TokensController module. The router is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to user authentication and JSON Web Tokens. It maps the Create method of the SessionsController to a POST route on the router.

spec/controllers/tokens.spec.js: This file contains a test suite for the TokensController module. The suite tests the behavior of the /tokens endpoint, which is responsible for handling user authentication and returning a JSON Web Token.

spec/models/token_generator.spec.js: This file contains a test suite for the TokenGenerator module. The suite tests the behavior of the jsonwebtoken method, which is responsible for generating a JSON Web Token.

These files depend on each other and interact with each other in the following way:

controllers/tokens.js depends on the User and TokenGenerator models to handle user authentication and generate JSON Web Tokens.

models/token_generator.js exports a method that is used by the SessionsController module to generate a JSON Web Token for authenticated users.

routes/tokens.js maps the Create method of the SessionsController to a POST route on the /tokens endpoint.

spec/controllers/tokens.spec.js tests the behavior of the /tokens endpoint by sending HTTP requests to it and checking the response status and JSON Web Token.

spec/models/token_generator.spec.js tests the behavior of the jsonwebtoken method by generating a token and decoding its payload to ensure it contains the expected data.

Together, these files create a simple yet effective authentication system that allows users to authenticate with their email and password and receive a JSON Web Token that can be used to authenticate future requests.
